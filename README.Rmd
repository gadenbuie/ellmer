The goal of elmer is to provide a user friendly wrapper over the most common llm providers. Major design goals include support for streaming and making it easy to register and call R functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of elmer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidyverse/elmer")
```

## Providers

elmer supports a number of model providers:

* Anthropic's Claude: `chat_claude()`.
* AWS Bedrock: `chat_bedrock()`.
* Azure OpenAI: `chat_azure()`.
* GitHub model marketplace: `chat_github()`.
* Google Gemini: `chat_gemini()`.
* Groq: `chat_groq()`.
* Ollama local models: `chat_ollama()`.
* OpenAI: `chat_openai()`.
* perplexity.ai: `chat_perplexity()`.
* Snowflake Cortex: `chat_cortex()`.

### Model choice

If you're using elmer inside your organisation, you'll be limited to what your org allows, which is likely to be one of `chat_databricks()`, `chat_bedrock()`, or `chat_azure()`.

If you're using elmer for your own personal exploration, we recommend starting with:

- `chat_openai()`, which defaults to **GPT-4o-mini**. You might want to try `model = "gpt-4o"` for more demanding tasks, or `model = "o1-mini"` if you want to force complex reasoning.

- `chat_claude()`, which defaults to **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**. This currently appears to be the best model for code generation.

- Try `chat_gemini()` if you want to put a lot of data in the prompt. This provider defaults to the **Gemini 1.5 Flash** model which supports 1 million tokens, compared to 200k for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and 128k for GPT 4o mini.

## Using elmer

You can work with elmer in several different ways, depending on whether you are working interactively or programmatically. They all start with creating a new chat object:

```r
library(elmer)

chat <- chat_openai(
  model = "gpt-4o-mini",
  system_prompt = "You are a friendly but terse assistant.",
)
```

Chat objects are stateful: they retain the context of the conversation, so each new query can build on the previous ones. This is true regardless of which of the various ways of chatting you use.

### Interactive chat console

The most interactive, least programmatic way of using elmer is to chat with it directly in your R console with `live_console(chat)` or in your browser with `live_browser()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
live_console(chat)
#> ╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
#> ║  Entering chat console. Use """ for multi-line input.  ║
#> ║  Press Ctrl+C to quit.                                 ║
#> ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#> >>> Who were the original creators of R?
#> R was originally created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of
#> Auckland, New Zealand.
#>
#> >>> When was that?
#> R was initially released in 1995. Development began a few years prior to that,
#> in the early 1990s.
```

Keep in mind that the chat object retains state, so when you enter the chat console, any previous interactions with that chat object are still part of the conversation, and any interactions you have in the chat console will persist even after you exit back to the R prompt.

Interactive chat is useful for quickly exploring the capabilities of the model, especially when you've customized the chat object with tool integrations (see below).

### Interactive method call

The second most interactive way to chat using elmer is to call the `chat()` method.

```{r eval=FALSE}
chat$chat("What preceding languages most influenced R?")
#> R was primarily influenced by the S programming language, particularly S-PLUS.
#> Other languages that had an impact include Scheme and various data analysis
#> languages.
```

If you initialize the chat object in the global environment, the `chat` method streams the response to the console as it arrives. When the entire response is received, it is returned as a character vector (invisibly, so it's not printed twice).

If you want to ask a question about an image, you can pass one or more additional input arguments using `content_image_file()` and/or `content_image_url()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
chat$chat(
  content_image_url("https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png"),
  "Can you explain this logo?"
)
#> The logo of R features a stylized letter "R" in blue, enclosed in an oval shape that resembles the letter "O,"
#> signifying the programming language's name. The design conveys a modern and professional look, reflecting its use
#> in statistical computing and data analysis. The blue color often represents trust and reliability, which aligns
#> with R's role in data science.
```

This mode is useful when you want to see the response as it arrives, but you don't want to enter the chat console.

### Programmatic chat

If you create the chat object inside a function, live streaming is automatically suppressed and `$chat()` returns the result as a string:

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_function <- function() {
  chat <- chat_openai(
    model = "gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt = "You are a friendly but terse assistant.",
  )
  chat$chat("Is R a functional programming language?")
}
my_function()
#> [1] "Yes, R supports functional programming concepts. It allows functions to be first-class objects, supports higher-order functions, and encourages the use of functions as core components of code. However, it also supports procedural and object-oriented programming styles."
```

You can manually control this behaviour with the `echo` argument.

This mode is useful for programming using elmer , when the result is either not intended for human consumption or when you want to process the response before displaying it.
